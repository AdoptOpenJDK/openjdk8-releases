# LEGACY REPOSITORY

This is now a legacy repository for AdoptOpenJDK's earlier OpenJDK8 releases.  Please see [here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk8-binaries/releases) going forwards.

# Releases

This (legacy) repository is for publishing all of the tagged releases which match releases from OpenJDK proper (http://openjdk.java.net).

These binaries are built on a shared CI infrastructure (see http://ci.adoptopenjdk.net) using an openly shared build tool chain (see https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build)
